The incident is attributed to OAuth scope mismatches between different internal services. Approximately 17,168 clients could be potentially affected, involving several cloud instances. The incident has resulted in 2LO permissions being incorrectly enabled, causing potential access issues. Some customers may notice unauthorized system users in their directories, which currently pose no identified security risk.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nThe short term fix involving Workspace ARI's will be rolled out cautiously over today and should resolve some highly impacted installations. \n\nFull restoration via backfill scripts is being developed, though this will at least take the remainder of the week to cautiously roll out to production.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe backfill process for a permanent data correction is set to begin, with rigorous monitoring planned to observe system behavior. \n\nNew communication updates are scheduled to occur within the next 12 hours, or sooner if significant developments arise.\n\nIf you believe that you are impacted by this incident, and need assistance, then we recommend raising a support ticket.",
