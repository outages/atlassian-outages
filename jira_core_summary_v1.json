We are beginning to shift towards a more automated process to restore sites. That said, there are still a number of steps required before we hand a site to customers for review and acceptance.\nWe are restoring affected customers identified by a mix of multiple variables including site size, complexity, edition, tenure, and several other factors in groups of up to 60 at a time. The full restoration process involves our engineering teams, our customer support teams, and our customer, and has three steps:\n  1. Technical restoration involving meta-data recovery, data restores across a number of services, and ensuring the data across the different systems is working correctly for product and ecosystem apps\n  2. Verification of site functionality to ensure the technical restoration has worked as expected\n  3. Lastly, working directly with the affected customer to enable them to verify their data and functionality before enabling for their users\nWe have also contacted all customers who are *up next* for step 3 in the site restoration process described above. These customers are aware that they are next in queue through their support ticket and/or via a support engineer.\nWe have proactively reached out to technical contacts and system admins at all impacted customers, and opened support tickets for each of them. However, we learned that some customers have not yet heard from us or engaged with our support team.
