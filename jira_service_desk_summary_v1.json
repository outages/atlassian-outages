These settings can block media (images and videos) content from loading, uploading, or opening.\n\nThe issue is triggered by Edge's Strict tracking prevention incorrectly classifying Atlassian as advertising, impacting functionality.\n\nRecommended Workarounds:\n- Switch your tracking prevention settings from 'Strict' to the 'Balanced (Recommended)' mode in Edge.\n- Alternatively, add an 'Exception' for the URL you use to access Atlassian products.\n- Use a different browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.\n\nThis issue only affects Microsoft Edge. Other browsers are not affected by this issue.\nThank you for your patience as we work through this issue. We'll provide updates as they become available.",
